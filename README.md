# Codec â€“ Encode & Decode for TypeScript

A TypeScript library that provides a strongly-typed and
user-friendly API for encoding and decoding data types.

Inspired by Swift's Codable API, this library aims to offer
a straightforward functional API for basic encoding and
decoding tasks. While it's a simplified initial release,
future iterations will introduce more advanced features.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to this
repository's GitHub Pages.

## Disclaimer

This repository is the first step in open-sourcing our more
advanced internal `ts-codec` solution:

* Expect additional features in upcoming versions.
* We strive for stability, but some issues may arise.

The long-term goal is to transition from an internal-first
to an external-first dependency model. The code used
internally may differ slightly from this open-source
version, so minor discrepancies are possible.
